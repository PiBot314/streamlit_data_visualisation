So this uses an old version of streamlit. I'll update it soon as possible

xbee_sim acts as an xbee but with non-realistic data. It will send the data through a port onto the computer. TODO - Convert the data to take it from flight_data.csv
xbee_log saves the realtime data into a file
the visualiser takes static data and visualises it
the dynamic visualiser will take realtime data and visualise.
